# process-css-demo

A demo of [process-css](https://github.com/tomhodgins/process-css) set up as a Node-based CSS preprocessor for supporting custom at-rules, custom selectors, custom properties, custom functions, and custom units.

## Installation

Download, run `npm install` and optionally `npm link`, then use with node:

```js
node index.js /path/to/stylesheet.css
```

The result will be JavaScript including all of the original styles, plus any runtimes necessary for supporting the custom extensions (if they're a CSS -> JS transformation instead of a simple CSS -> CSS transformation).
